# XDCJackpot

Instructions

Each player can click the button to enter the jackpot, doing so costs 1000 XDC. Upon clicking the button, a timer begins counting down from 5 minutes. If another player clicks the button, the jackpot is increased and the timer is reset at 5 minutes. If the timer completes, the last player to bet may claim their reward and win everything in the jackpot. Another game begins as soon as another player bets again!
